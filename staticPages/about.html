Point your server to the public folder and you have your personal blog set up. Simply paste new files into the <i>/pages</i> folder to list them automatically in you website as articles. No databases. No authentication. Page titles are automatically set with file names.<br><br>

<i><span class="highlight">/staticPages</i> folder has all static pages that can be linked with <i><a href="/s/static_page.html">/s/static_page.html</a></i><br><br>
<i><span class="highlight">/pages</i> folder has all the articles that you want to share.<br>
Pages are directly linked with their names eg: <i><a href="/random_page1">/random_page1</a></i><br>
